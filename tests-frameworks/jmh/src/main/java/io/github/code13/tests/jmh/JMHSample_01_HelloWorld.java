   * This is our first benchmark method.
   *
   * JMH works as follows: users annotate the methods with @Benchmark, and
   * then JMH produces the generated code to run this particular benchmark as
   * reliably as possible. In general one might think about @Benchmark methods
   * as the benchmark "payload", the things we want to measure. The
   * surrounding infrastructure is provided by the harness itself.
   *
   * Read the Javadoc for @Benchmark annotation for complete semantics and
   * restrictions. At this point we only note that the methods names are
   * non-essential, and it only matters that the methods are marked with
   * @Benchmark. You can have multiple benchmark methods within the same
   * class.
   *
   * Note: if the benchmark method never finishes, then JMH run never finishes
   * as well. If you throw an exception from the method body the JMH run ends
   * abruptly for this benchmark and JMH will run the next benchmark down the
   * list.
   *
   * Although this benchmark measures "nothing" it is a good showcase for the
   * overheads the infrastructure bear on the code you measure in the method.
   * There are no magical infrastructures which incur no overhead, and it is
   * important to know what are the infra overheads you are dealing with. You
   * might find this thought unfolded in future examples by having the
   * "baseline" measurements to compare against.

  /*
   * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
   *
   * You are expected to see the run with large number of iterations, and
   * very large throughput numbers. You can see that as the estimate of the
   * harness overheads per method call. In most of our measurements, it is
   * down to several cycles per call.
   *
   * a) Via command-line:
   *    $ mvn clean install
   *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_01
   *
   * JMH generates self-contained JARs, bundling JMH together with it.
   * The runtime options for the JMH are available with "-h":
   *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -h
   *
   * b) Via the Java API:
   *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
   *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)

  /*
   * Idea 下载 JMH 插件：
   *        https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7529-jmh-java-microbenchmark-harness
   * 就可以直接下面的运行下面的 main 方法。注意请直接使用 run 模式，不要使用 debug 模式！！！

   * 所有的报告均在 prettier-frameworks/jmh/result 目录下
