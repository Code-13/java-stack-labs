/**
 * vavr Values
 * <p>
 * In a functional setting we see a value as a kind of normal form, an expression which cannot be further evaluated.
 * In Java we express this by making the state of an object final and call it immutable.
 * Vavrâ€™s functional Value abstracts over immutable objects.
 * Efficient write operations are added by sharing immutable memory between instances. What we get is thread-safety for free!
