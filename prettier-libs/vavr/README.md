# [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/)

Vavr core is a functional library for Java. It helps to reduce the amount of code and to increase
the robustness. A first step towards functional programming is to start thinking in immutable
values. Vavr provides immutable collections and the necessary functions and control structures to
operate on these values. The results are beautiful and just work.
