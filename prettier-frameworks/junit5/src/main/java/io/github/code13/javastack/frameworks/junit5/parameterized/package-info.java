/**
 * ParameterizedTests.
 *
 * <p>Parameterized tests make it possible to run a test multiple times with different arguments.
 * They are declared just like regular @Test methods but use the @ParameterizedTest annotation
 * instead. In addition, you must declare at least one source that will provide the arguments for
 * each invocation and then consume the arguments in the test method.
